# Note Taker Project

## Description

This project was made to assist people that need a little help staying organized, it will allow you to save to-do notes that you can pull up at a later time and view or delete them as you complete them.  The project was a fantastic challenge for really getting in there and learning about modular routing, which was rather difficult for me.  I hope this project is exactly what you are looking for! (If you are looking for a professional looking note taking application!)

## Usage

Clear out the default wedding theme'd To-Dos and create your own with the plus icon in the top right corner, once you have the To-Do created just save it by clicking on the floppy disk icon in the top right corner.  You can view a saved To-Do Note by clicking on one of the saved notes on the left side and you can also delete any of the saved notes by clicking on the red trashcan icon on each of the saved notes.
